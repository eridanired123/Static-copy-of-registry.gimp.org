'''
Gimp plugin.

Create new image having texture synthesized from the selection.
Works best if selection is natural (fractal).
Can work with man-made regular texture.
Works worst with man-made, structured but not regular, symbols.
Sometimes called rendering a texture.

Requires resynthesizer plug-in.

The effect for users:
Similar to "Fill resynthesized pattern" except:
  - here the arguments are reversed: you select a texture and create a new image
    instead of selecting an area and choosing a pattern.
  - here the result is less random (since Fill resynthesized adds noise.)
Different from tiling since:
  - seamless and irregular pattern

The continuum of randomness versus speed:
  - Filters.Map.Tile is fast but has seams and regular pattern (even if you use "Make Seamless" first.)
  - Filter.Render.Texture a tile followed by tiling is seamless but still has regularity.
  - Filte.Render.Texture an entire image is slower but seamless and moderately irregular.
  - Edit.Fill with resynthesized pattern is slowest but seamless and highly irregular, unpatterned.

This filter is not tiling (instead resynthesizing) but makes 
an image that you can then use to tile with especially if
you choose the option to make the edges suitable for tiling.  

IN: The selection (or the entire active drawable) is the source of texture and is not changed.
OUT New image, possibly resized canvas, same scale and resolution.
