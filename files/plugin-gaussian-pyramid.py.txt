'''
GIMP plugin that generates a Gaussian pyramid.

A Gaussian pyramid is a sequence of images where each is down-sampled
(smaller dimensions in pixels, i.e. resolution) from previous image.
Loosely speaking, each is blurred from the previous,
but blur depends on the resolution of the display device and size image is displayed.

This is a brute force method.
There an elegant and much faster (but harder to program) algorithm, using the "gaussian reduce operator."

  List of images which is a Gaussian pyramid.
  
  Behaves as a list.  Images generated at init.
  
  Image at subscript [0] is original image.
  Each image contains a scaled selection mask like the original.
  Hardcoded to scale by half.
  
  Boundary conditions: downsample an image to one pixel in the smallest dimension.
